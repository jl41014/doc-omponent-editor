Leadership
1.Initiative and Problem-Solving
    1)At the beginning of CBNA project development, I found our Java SQL reflect column utility only support fixed SQL execution but not support dynamic condition SQL execution. I initiative told team leader and implement the solution. Meanwhile, the BAU function can’t support Date and Timestamp field reflect. I fixed this issue in the new method.
    2)I initiative take part in many POC implement. For example:
        a.the java DTO field remap utility, even though the task is not assign to me, I initiative participated in discussion, gave the solution and implemented the initial POC. 
        b.I implemented a POC for PDF edit system which can use in RBQ term-sheet or other PDF document. In BAU, if user want to update the PDF template, they need to ask developer to change the template content. In the POC system, it can make user freely edit the PDF template in a rich editor online and generate a PDF sample for review to change the template content real time.
        c.RBQ UI enhancement in single HTML/JSP file to make the screen looks more kindly.

2.Team Collaboration
I actively participated in our weekly team meetings, contributing ideas and providing feedback on ongoing projects. I am glad to work in team cooperation. I have never rejected the request of team colleagues but try my best to help them instead. And I’d also never be shy to ask for help from team colleagues. 

3.Mentoring and Support
    1)After our team changed the work mode, many host colleagues started to implement Java API. I often helped them debug and provide my idea for Java solution. Usually I not directly provide the code but guide them thinking in Java to resolve the issue. 
    2)In CBNA project, I was responsible for mentoring Dylan who was newly joined in our team to implement the bond sync API. It’s smoothly to delivery in UAT2 and there is no defect til now.
    3)I summarized my knowledge into team confluence page, like angular/SpringBoot workspace setup, copilot setup and a serials of Angular development guidance.  

4.Decision-Making
I played a key role in deciding the tech stack for our new project. I conducted a thorough analysis of various options, presented my findings to the team, and facilitated a discussion that led to a consensus on the best choice.

5.Influence and Leadership
This year I could clearly feel the responsible I took is more than last two years, which means my role in the team became more important. 

Goals for the Next Six Months
Continue to enhance my leadership skills by taking more responsibility in project development and team coordination.
Actively make knowledge-sharing sessions to promote continuous learning within the team.
Keep learning soft skills such as communication and English speaking to better support my team.
Continuously learn tech stack to support team works. 


Risk
In the past six months, as a developer, I have adhered to all relevant policies and procedures, identified and reported potential risks, ensured compliance with regulatory requirements, contributed to process improvements, and effectively responded to incidents.

Adherence to Policies:
I have consistently adhered to Citi’s security policies and procedures, ensuring that all development activities comply with regulatory standards.

Risk Identification and Reporting:
I identified a potential security vulnerability in our application during a code review and reported it promptly. This proactive approach helped us address the issue before it could be exploited.




financial
Over the past six months, I have made contributions to the financial performance of our projects.

Cost Management
Each time I implement a POC for the projects, If need to dependency on third party library, I would to choose the open source version to implement even though the features are not abundant with charge one. 

Budget Adherence
I strictly adhered the team PTS plan to fill in my PTS clocking without overspending.

Efficiency Improvements
    1)Supported James to implement converting API swagger to Java DTO utility that can help API developer save much coding time.
    2)Implemented dynamic conditions SQL execution reflect to DTO utility, which can help simplify the process of map SQL result to DTO to save coding time.


Client
In the past six months, I have focused on enhancing client satisfaction, building strong client relationships, delivering effective solutions, contributing to the franchise’s value, and aligning my efforts with our strategic goals.

Kept learning to widen tech stack
    1)Learned Java 8 new features, made a share sessions to team members and use in code.
    2)Learned Angular material custom theme and I am trying to custom a theme to support FIS UI development.
    3)Learned SpringBoot3 new features to support BAU SpringBoot2.X upgrade.
    4)Java 17 will replace Java 8 as LMS version. I will keep learning Java 8 to 17 new features to find out if any awesome features can use in our projects to enhance performance or coding styles.

Tried to relocate my role in the team
    1)In CBNA and CHKL projects, I started to try to analyst the requirement and design the code implement. And in CBNA project, I fully mentored Dylan, new joined in our team, to implement the code of bond sync API include design, code review, unit testing etc whole processes and final delivery into UAT2 smoothly and no defect til now. 
    2)Started to think how to enhance coding process such as make some utilities to simplify the code.

Shared my knowledge
Based on my develop experience, I summarized my knowledge in team confluence, include Angular/SpringBoot workspace setup, copilot setup and a serials of angular development guidance.
